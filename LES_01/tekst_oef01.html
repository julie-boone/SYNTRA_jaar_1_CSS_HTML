    <h1>Basic HTML animals</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page.<br />
        It introduces our animals.</p>
    <h2>The Llama</h2>
    <p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items.</p>
    <p>When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</p>
    <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
    <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his
        prey.</p>
