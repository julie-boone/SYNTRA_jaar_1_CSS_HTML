    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <p><em> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different
            recipes that I have read over the years.<br>
            Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with
            salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you want a <em>coarse "chunky"</em> hummus, process it for a <strong>short</strong> time<br>
        If you want a <em>smooth</em> hummus, process it for a <strong>longer</strong> time<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For a <strong>different flavour</strong>, you could try blending in a small measure of:
    <ul>
        <li>lemon and coriander</li>
        <li>chili pepper</li>
        <li>lime and chipotle</li>
        <li>harissa and mint</li>
        <li>or spinach and feta cheese</li>
    </ul> Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
        made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
